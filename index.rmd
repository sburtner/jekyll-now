## Hi, I'm Su!

You can spell my name Su or Sue, I don't mind either way.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Geography department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before this, I was a research associate in the Geographic Information Science and Technology group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Before that, I was "master"-ing urban spatial analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. And even before that, I was studying operations research and management science at the University of California, Berkeley. I hail from the Sacramento area, specifically the city of Elk Grove, California, and have a deep love and appreciation for the entire northern California region.

**Network science**, **spatial data science**, **spatial optimization**, **geographic information science**, ... these are my things, and I am particularly interested in applying quantitative and computational methods in social science and public health contexts (see my [CV](cv.html)). But I enjoy a lot of other things too, like surfing, paddling (outrigger canoe and dragonboat), skateboarding, Olympic weightlifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu, expanding and caring for my posse of plants, and visiting breweries with my dog Flower. I strongly believe in having an identity outside of work, but thankfully I am passionate about that as well.

### Purpose of this website

I created this website to help document my PhD experience and daylight past and current projects. There are tabs for academic and passion projects. The [research](research.html) tab highlights projects produced through research, while [passion projects](passion_projects.html) highlights those from coursework, through university, departmental, or community service, or conducted in my free time. This website is not an exhaustive collection of everything I have ever done, and updates will happen haphazardly.
