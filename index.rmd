## Hi, I'm Su!

You can spell my name Su or Sue, I don't mind either way.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Geography department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before this, I was a research associate in the Geographic Information Science and Technology group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Before that, I was "master"-ing urban spatial analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. And even before that, I was studying operations research and management science at the University of California, Berkeley. I call Sacramento home, specifically the city of Elk Grove, California, and have a deep love and appreciation for the northern California region.

**Spatial data science**, **spatial optimization**, **Network science**, **geographic information science**... these are my things (see my [CV](cv.html)). But I enjoy a lot of other things too, like surfing, paddling (outrigger canoe and dragonboat), skateboarding, Olympic weightlifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu, caring for a growing posse of plants, and visiting breweries with my dog Flower. I strongly believe in having an identity outside of work, but thankfully I am passionate about that as well.

### Purpose of this website

I created this website to help document my PhD experience and daylight past and current projects. There are tabs for academic and passion projects. The [research](research.html) tab highlights projects produced through research, while [passion projects](passion_projects.html) highlights those produced from coursework, through service (university, departmental, or community), or conducted in my free time. This website is not an exhaustive collection of everything I have ever done, and updates may happen haphazardly.

### Contact

I welcome any comments or questions you may have about me or my work; please feel free to send me a message using one of the links in the header.
