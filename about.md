## Hi, I'm Su!

You can spell it Su or Sue, I don't mind either way.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Geography department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before this, I was a research associate in the Geographic Information Science and Technology group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Before that, I was "master"-ing urban spatial analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. And even before that, I was studying operations research and management science at the University of California, Berkeley.

**Geographic information science**, **network science**, **spatial data science**, ... those are my things. But I enjoy a lot of other things too, like surfing, paddling (outrigger canoe and dragonboat), Olympic weightlifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu and visiting breweries with my dog Flower. I strongly believe in having an identity outside of work, but thankfully I am passionate about that as well.


## Purpose of this website

I created this website to help document my PhD experience and daylight past and current projects. There are tabs for academic and passion projects. Academic projects include those produced from a university course or through research, while passion projects are those I did in my free time. In the future, I hope to add a tab for my diversity and inclusion work, which has become an increasingly important part of my departmental and community service.
