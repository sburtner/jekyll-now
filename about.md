I spell my name in a non-traditional fashion, I know.

I go by Su, and I am currently a PhD student studying Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before this, I was a research associate in the Geographic Information Science and Technology group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Before that, I was "master"-ing Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. And even before that, I was a squirrelly engineering student at the University of California, Berkeley. Apparently I love school!

Network science, spatial data science, geographic information systems... those are my "things". But I love a lot of other things too, like surfing, paddling, weightlifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu, and my dog, Flower. I am truly a nerd-jock with a perennial identity crisis.


## Purpose of this website

I created this website to help document my PhD experience. I hope this can be a launching point for "daylighting" my current and future work.


### Research & teaching philosophy

My research is very interdisciplinary, and collaboration is a key tenet of my research philosophy.

I want to make room for the "acadmeic", the "stakeholder", and the "amateur" in my work. I strongly belive in shared interpretation and the coproduction of knowledge. We are all teachers, and we are all students.

I love meeting and talking to new people, so in that spirit, I attempt to make my work public as an invitation to hear from and work with... YOU!
