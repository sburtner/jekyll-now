## Hi, I'm Su!

You can spell it Su or Sue, I don't mind either way.

I am currently a PhD student in the Geography department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before this, I was a research associate in the Geographic Information Science and Technology group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Before that, I was "master"-ing Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. And even before that, I was a French and political science turned engineering student at the University of California, Berkeley.

**Geographic information Science**, **network science**, **spatial data science**, ... those are my "things". But I love a lot of other things too, like surfing, paddling, weightlifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu, and my dog, Flower. I firmly believe that you should have an identity outside of work, but thankfully I am passionate about that as well.


## Purpose of this website

I created this website to help document my PhD experience by "daylighting" my past and current research. The sites serves as a repository for projects that may or may not include accompanying data and documentation.


### Research & teaching philosophy

I identify as a human geographer, but I like to apply advanced computational techniques such as machine learning. I have always been engaged by interdisciplinary projects, and I try to draw from different fields when exploring and applying theoretical and analytical frames.

Research without teaching is a disservice to scholarship. I try to cultivate inclusive and active learning environments by fostering "psychological safety" in the classroom. I want my students to feel like they can ask me any question, or tell me if I am not explaining something well. I encourage feedback as it helps me reaffirm my ability to explain concepts and communicate ideas, which is vital to being a good teacher and researcher.


### Contact me

Please feel free to contact me with any comments, questions, or ideas for collaboration. I am always looking for cool and exciting projects or ways to give back.
