# Su's website

Welcome to the GitHub repo of my website!

## Overview

This section is for me. The flow of updating the website is as follows:
    - Open up the R project ("sburtner.github.io") in a new session
    - Modify any of the `.rmd` files corresponding to the tabs
    - Git `add`, `commit`, `push` as necessary
    - When you're ready, run `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = "UTF-8")` to automatically modify/generate the `.html` files
    - Git `add`, `commit`, `push` the `.html` files
    - Check the website to see that the changes got made (it may take several seconds)
