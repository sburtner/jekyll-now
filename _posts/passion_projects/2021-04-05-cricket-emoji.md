|<sub> *The cricket emoji that appears in the original proposal.* </sub>|

In fall of 2016, I decided to write to the Unicode Consortium to advocate for the inclusion of a new emoji: a cricket. My motivation for doing so (on top of avoiding finishing my graduate school applications) stemmed from the simple fact that *there was no cricket emoji*, and I felt that the world deserved to express awkward silences via text message.

This emoji experience has been wonderful. Not only was it fun to write the [proposal](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16300-cricket-emoji.pdf) and design the cricket in Adobe Illustrator, but I also used this as an opportunity to learn LaTeX, a [typsetting system](https://www.latex-project.org/) that I have come to love. I have since learned there is a large emoji community, [emojination](http://www.emojination.org/), who have a really active slack channel that helps other emoji enthusiasts get their proposals passed by the Emoji Subcommittee of Unicode.

I did a few radio, phone and email interviews about the emoji. For some reason, this was really picked up by Canadian news outlets. I think this is because I gave the BBC radio interview first, and I mentioned that my Canadian friend helped me design the emoji. I think that when I said my friend "designed" the emoji that people took that to mean that he did most of the work. To clarify, I did the research, wrote the proposal and made the first cricket mockup in Adobe Illustrator. My friend then helped me edited (that admittedly atrocious) cricket to what you see in the proposal. I laugh about it now.
