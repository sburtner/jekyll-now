Across these blog posts, it can be seen that various efforts are underway to breath life back into Islais Creek. Smaller projects even go beyond just exposing the water and natural habitat and address the [transportation infrastructural needs to access the creek](https://sf.streetsblog.org/2018/03/09/eyes-on-the-street-cargo-way-bike-lane-finally-gets-paved/). While I have greatly enjoyed looking at the physical and cultural ways that people are bringing attention to Islais Creek, I wanted to make a short blog post that specifically looks at this Hyper-Creek proposal.

## Are we doing enough?

There seems to be a growing sense of urgency in combatting climate change, so the political climate surrounding the Hyper-Creek is ripe for exploitation. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.

When we daylight a creek, we daylight all of the life forms dependent upon and surrounding its existence. By daylighting Islais Creek, we daylight issues of the water-runoff-sewage infrastructure of San Francisco. We daylight issues of drug use and homelessness in the city. We daylight the safety and sustainability of water recreation, tourism, and youth development for residents and non-residents. But we also daylight the active efforts of people like Kayaks Unlimited, Flyaway Productions and the Copra Dock Dances, and all those who have come before. The creekâ€™s history is important to keep in mind even as new, futuristic-like efforts are underway to revitalize the area.
