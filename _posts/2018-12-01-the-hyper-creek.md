## Are we doing enough?

While some political leaders are dragging their feet on climate change policy, some citizens have had enough. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.

When we daylight a creek, we daylight all of the life forms dependent upon and surrounding its existence. By daylighting Islais Creek, we daylight issues of the water-runoff-sewage infrastructure of San Francisco. We daylight issues of drug use and homelessness in the city. We daylight the safety and sustainability of water recreation, tourism, and youth development for residents and non-residents. But we also daylight the active efforts of people like Kayaks Unlimited, Flyaway Productions and the Copra Dock Dances, and all those who have come before. The creek’s history is important to keep in mind even as new efforts are underway to revitalize the area.

This blog post builds upon the last to update the reader on the current status of Islais Creek, and also weaves together my personal relationship with the creek and some of those helping to bring it to the daylight.

The movement to daylight Islais Creek echoes broader efforts worldwide to better address the urban resilience, the intersection of human development.

Talk about water… Talk about aquatic/urban nexus…

Removing housing and reintroducing open water into an urban community would require
community outreach and education to help people appreciate the stream and visualize the potential
for neighborhood improvement.
Daylighting Islais Creek for stormwater conveyance would reduce combined sewer
overflows into San Francisco Bay and the city streets, reduce the threat of flooding, reduce the 
21
inflow to wastewater treatment plants, create aquatic habitat, create public recreational space, and
advance understanding of urban water management.
