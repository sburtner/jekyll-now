In college I was obsessed with paddling. I would often ditch class if the weather was good to take an outrigger canoe out into the Bay, launching from a boat dock in Alameda. The view of San Francisco from the water is stunning. The city seems to exist as one massive entity, not a collection of a billion moving parts. And yet, the infrastructure of the city is mostly invisible from the water, with the exception of the Bay and Golden Gate bridges, as buildings and houses line the shore and obscure the active city beyond.

Of course, it's not always easy to take a picture of the city from the water, because the water in the Bay can be quite tumultuous. A single mariner in a non-motorized boat has to be careful of the undulating waves, large cargo ships, and the occasional curious seal hoping for a rest on a smooth hull. During my college years, I was hoping to find a stretch of water to train sprints on nearby that was flat, smooth, and protected. I pulled up Google Maps one day and didn't find much in the East Bay that I didn't already know about. But upon looking onto the earstern shores of San Francisco, I came across a little channel named "Islais Creek." Intrigued, I drove my car out there a few days later and met with someone from the local paddling group, Kayaks Unlimited. From then on the creek would become an important part of my training, my community outreach, and my relationship to San Francisco.

Little did I know that each time I paddled at Islais Creek, I was launching a canoe from diminishing shores and into polluted and unsanitary water, unknowingly skimming the surface of problems surrounding urban development amd climate change. Years later, I reflect upon how my ability to enjoy the waters of the Bay Area may drastically change in the coming years. For me, water is not only a source of life but a source of true joy. Islais Creek features prominently in my nostalgia of San Francisco, yet I have never thought to reflect on its resiliency, its precarious future in the face of climate change. Until now.


## Urban-water nexus and urban resilience

What does it mean for a city to be "resilient"? According to the UN 2017 report, [*Trends in Urban Resilience*](https://unhabitat.org/books/trends-in-urban-resilience-2017/), "the resilience of a city is directly dependent on 'the capability of all the physical components of the system, including buildings and transportation infrastructures, to absorb the damages due to an external shock and to quickly restore their state before the shock.'" Resilience can be viewed from engineering, ecological, and socio-ecological perspectives, but across these frames, is still "viewed as a process, a state and a quality."

Water is an important facet of resiliency thinking and planning. Floods account for the most deaths by natural disasters worldwide, and has resulted in an [estimated 6.8 million deaths in the 20th century](http://currents.plos.org/disasters/index.html%3Fp=6695.html). The [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300) include several agendas for directly addressing global issues dealing with water, including clean "water and sanitation" and "life below water."

Progressive cities are taking notice of the increasing costs of flood mitigation, and attempting to make cities more resource efficient.


[According to ], (https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/how-the-urban-nexus-will-make-your-city-more-resource-efficient/)

The movement to daylight Islais Creek echoes broader efforts within the Bay and worldwide to better address urban resilience.

So how feasible, from a cost perspective, is it to actually daylight Islais Creek?

A recent study sought to answer this very question, and push for its implentation regardlesss.
> "Removing housing and reintroducing open water into an urban community would require community outreach and education to help people appreciate the stream and visualize the potential for neighborhood improvement. Daylighting Islais Creek for stormwater conveyance would reduce combined sewer overflows into San Francisco Bay and the city streets, reduce the threat of flooding, reduce the 21 inflow to wastewater treatment plants, create aquatic habitat, create public recreational space, and advance understanding of urban water management.


## Still, can we do more?

GIS (geographic information science, or systems) practitioners often let spatial data types affect our representation of the real world. We count things in points, lines, and polygons, but the world often cannot be reduced to such clear phenomena. Water is a particularly difficult entity to model. Watersheds, rivers and streams, water flow directions, these are all modeled in different ways. But one reoccuring problem is that despite 

Even in the picture at the top of this post, one sees the city and the imagination fires with thoughts of the people, places, and things that make San Francisco so unique. But the water is a part of the city just the same. The boundary of SF is uniquely defined by its surrounding water, and yet water flows in, out, and around the city in a constantly churning aquatic system. Those of us who make maps need to remember this. As GIS practioners, we must take on multi-layered approaches to viewing water in all its facets. It is only in this way that we can accurately bring to light how ever-present, how all-powerful, how always-important water is to everything it touches.

One group in particular is making Islais Creek the focal point of a ginormous project. The topic of the next blog post takes a closer look into the new proposed "Hyper-Creek", and how this affects the daylighting or masking of Islais Creek and the surrounding area.
