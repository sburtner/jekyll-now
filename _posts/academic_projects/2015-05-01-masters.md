## MUSA Capstone

For my master's degree, I had to complete a capstone project, which was like a master's thesis. My project was titled "Using GIS to Support In-Flight Operations in the Event of an Airport Outage." My master's committee included Professors Amy Hillier and Megan Ryerson from the University of Pennsylvania. They were incredible scholars, instructors and mentors. An image of the poster I credited based on my paper is below.

My work was also published in [Esri Map Book, Volume 31: 168-169, Esri Press](https://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&websiteID=309&moduleID=0)!
