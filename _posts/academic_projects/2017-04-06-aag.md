## Generating Building Exterior Wall Material Estimates Using Google Street View Imagery

When I was working at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), I was tasked with populating and managing a spatial database on global building information. Sometimes we would not have building information for many parts of countries or entire countries, so I decided to explore how we could leverage Google Street View imagery to improve the spatial coverage of our database. This led me to first test out how to use the Google Street View API to obtain oblique (or street level) imagery, scale that to extract thousands of labeled images of buildings based on known addresses and exterior wall material types (leveraging ORNL access to other building databases), and then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect "brick" or "no brick". I did most of my API calls, labeling and automated file organization in Python. I implemented the CNN architecture [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf), modified some parameters and ran the model on an ORNL Linux machine. I would have loved to continue this project, but it originally was just for exploration and I left ORNL a few months later to start my PhD program.
