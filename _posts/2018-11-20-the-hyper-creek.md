What does is mean to daylight a creek? What does it mean for the city?

How will the proposed Hyper-Islais Creek help the city become more resilient to climate change?

When we daylight a creek, we daylight all of the life forms dependent upon and surrounding its existence. By daylighting Islais Creek, we daylight issues of the water-runoff-sewage infrastructure of San Francisco. We daylight issues of drug use and homelessness in the city. We daylight the safety and sustainability of water recreation, tourism, and youth development for residents and non-residents. But we also daylight the active efforts of people like Kayaks Unlimited, Flyaway Productions and the Copra Dock Dances, and all those who have come before. The creekâ€™s history is important to keep in mind even as new efforts are underway to revitalize the area.

This blog post builds upon the last to update the reader on the current status of Islais Creek, and also weaves together my personal relationship with the creek and some of those helping to bring it to the daylight.
