What does is mean to daylight a creek? What does it mean for the city?

When we daylight a creek, we daylight all of the life forms dependent upon and surrounding its existence. By daylighting Islais Creek, we daylight issues of the water-runoff-sewage infrastructure of San Francisco. We daylight issues of drug use and homelessness in the city. We daylight the safety and sustainability of water recreation, tourism, and youth development for residents and non-residents. But we also daylight the active efforts of people like Kayaks Unlimited, Flyaway Productions and the Copra Dock Dances, and all those who have come before. The creekâ€™s history is important to keep in mind even as new efforts are underway to revitalize the area.

Final note on personal journey to help daylight this creek.
