title: Shit Creek (Blog Post \# 1)
---

Islais Creek sits at the mouth of the [Bernal Heights watershed in San Francisco, California](http://explore.museumca.org/creeks/1630-RescIslais.html#). From above, you can see that the 3rd St. bridge closes off the creek from the channel at the east end, while the tall, meandering roadways of the 280 and all of its speeding cars create an ominous, seemingly inpenetrable barrier at the west end.

On the ground, the landscape surrounding the creek is a somber mix of over-grown weeds, litter, and a bricolage of industrial stuctures such as concrete blocks, rusted steel beams, and wooden posts protruding from the water. Just beyond the raised banks on the northern end of the creek, rows of empty cars, vans, and tour buses stand at attention, waiting patiently until called upon by the myriad of auto and transporation companies that help San Francisco move. The southern end of the creek is no more lively with its collection of seemingly low-profile, garage-front and warehouse businesses, a scene altogether quite different from the hustle and bustle of the waterfront and Mission areas mere blocks away.

To most of the residents of San Francisco, Islais Creek is just like any other creek, and its location and industrial surroundings hardly make it a popular destination spot. But how the creek came to be in its current state is a fascinating story, embedded heavily into the history of San Francisco.

My intent with these blog posts goes beyond trying to push to "daylight" Islais Creek into some semblance of its natural form. I also hope to use these posts as an opportunity to reconnect the people of San Francisco to its aquatic infrastructures, its history, and the complex urban-aquatic nexus that forces us to challenge our role in the ongoing problems of climate change. In this series of blog posts, I introduce the history of Islais Creek, community and business efforts to revive the creek in various ways, all the while integrating the impact that climate change has had on all of these endeavours.


## The watershed (and the history) underneath

Looking at the creek today, it is difficult to imagine that it was once the primary source of the city's water. 80% of all drinking water came from Islais Creek. It also used to be over four miles in length, stretching from the Bay all the way to the Pacific Ocean. But the creek underwent dramatic changes during the 20th century. 

Talk about water… Talk about aquatic/urban nexus…


## Climate change/Frankenstein

Some have called climate change one of society's modern-day "Frankenstein's" (Joshua Rothman, *The New Yorker*). Like Frankenstein, climate change was made by and is continually scorned by its creator: the human race. Climate change is easy to ignore... when everything is going fine. But increasing severe weather patterns, expose the incredible, destructive power humans have had on this planet.

Humans, in their widespread geographic locales, collectively contribute to this global problem (though some more than others.) Ironically, there is one element that humans cannot repair nor replace, and this is water. 

## So, what happens next?

I found Islais Creek back in college when I was obsessed with paddling. At the time, I had my own canoe but wanted to train sprints somewhere where the water was flat. The problem with my relationship with the creek was that like most of the city of San Francisco, I had no idea about the history of the creek and was merely using it for my own selfish purposes. That’s when I became more involved with the volunteer organizations that help keep the creek clean.

Why was there so much interest in preserving this tiny creek? This tiny creek had a massive role in the urban development of San Francisco.

While some political leaders are dragging their feet on climate change policy, some citizens have had enough. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.
