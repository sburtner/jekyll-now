Islais Creek sits at the mouth of the [Bernal Heights watershed in San Francisco, California](http://explore.museumca.org/creeks/1630-RescIslais.html#). From above, you can see that the 3rd St. bridge closes off the creek from the channel at the east end, while the tall, meandering lanes of the 280 and all of its speeding cars create an ominous, impenetrable barrier at the west end.

On the ground, the landscape surrounding the creek is a somber mix of over-grown weeds, litter, and industrial stuctures, including concrete blocks, rusted steel beams, and wooden posts protruding from the water. Just beyond the raised banks on the northern end of the creek, rows of empty cars, vans, and tour buses stand at attention, waiting patiently until called upon by the myriad of auto and tourist companies that help transport San Francisco's commuters. The southern end of the creek is similarly serene with its collection of low-profile, garage-front and warehouse businesses, a scene altogether quite different from the hustle and bustle of the waterfront and Mission areas mere blocks away.

To most of the residents of San Francisco, Islais Creek is largely unknown. Its location, reputation for attracting skaters and homeless individuals, and industrial surroundings make it a less-than-popular destination spot. The natural and physical form of the creek, just like its history, meanders in and out of visibility, largely due to the whim of city planners who have made decisions with people and profit first, nature second. Most of Islais Creek remains hidden underground, built over by years of urban development, and disaster.

But recently, the attitude towards the creek is changing. Over the past few years, there have been several efforts by different groups to "daylight" Islais Creek. The process of [daylighting](http://americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AmericanRivers_daylighting-streams-report.pdf), according to [AmericanRivers.org](https://www.americanrivers.org/conservation-resource/daylighting-streams-breathing-life-urban-streams-communities/), "involves uncovering some or all of the previously covered river, stream, or stormwater drainage. Although most stream daylighting involves restoring a stream to a more natural state, other forms include architectural and cultural restoration."

Ironically, more of the "uncovering" of Islais Creek is happening through these latter forms of restoration. A statue and marquee commemorating the creek were erected in early efforts to

The movement to daylight Islais Creek echoes broader efforts worldwide to better address the urban resilience, the intersection of human development. 

My intent with these blog posts goes beyond trying to push to "daylight" Islais Creek into some semblance of its natural form. I also hope to use these posts as an opportunity to reconnect the people of San Francisco to its aquatic infrastructures, its history, and the complex urban-aquatic nexus that forces us to challenge our role in the ongoing problems of climate change. In this series of blog posts, I introduce the history of Islais Creek, community and business efforts to revive the creek in various ways, all the while integrating the impact that climate change has had on all of these endeavours.


## The watershed (and the history) underneath

Looking at the creek today, it is difficult to imagine that it was once the primary source of the city's water. 80% of all drinking water came from Islais Creek. It also used to be over four miles in length, stretching from the Bay all the way to the Pacific Ocean. But the creek underwent dramatic changes during the 20th century. [Up until the 1950's](https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/islais-creek) Islais Creek was essentially an open sewage, and that's how it got it's name as "Shit Creek."

Talk about water… Talk about aquatic/urban nexus…


## Climate change/Frankenstein

Some have called climate change one of society's modern-day "Frankenstein's" (Joshua Rothman, *The New Yorker*). Like Frankenstein, climate change was made by and is continually scorned by its creator: the human race. Climate change is easy to ignore... when everything is going fine. But increasing severe weather patterns, expose the incredible, destructive power humans have had on this planet.

Humans, in their widespread geographic locales, collectively contribute to this global problem (though some more than others.) Ironically, there is one element that humans cannot repair nor replace, and this is water. 

## So, what happens next?

I found Islais Creek back in college when I was obsessed with paddling. At the time, I had my own canoe but wanted to train sprints somewhere where the water was flat. The problem with my relationship with the creek was that like most of the city of San Francisco, I had no idea about the history of the creek and was merely using it for my own selfish purposes. That’s when I became more involved with the volunteer organizations that help keep the creek clean.

Why was there so much interest in preserving this tiny creek? This tiny creek had a massive role in the urban development of San Francisco.

While some political leaders are dragging their feet on climate change policy, some citizens have had enough. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.
