Some have called climate change one of society's modern-day "Frankenstein's" (Joshua Rothman, *The New Yorker*). Like Frankenstein, climate change was made by and is continually scorned by its creator: the human race. Climate change is easy to ignore... when everything is going fine. But increasing severe weather patterns, expose the incredible, destructive power humans have had on this planet.

Humans, in their widespread geographic locales, collectively contribute to this global problem (though some more than others.) Ironically, there is one element that humans cannot repair nor replace, and this is water.
