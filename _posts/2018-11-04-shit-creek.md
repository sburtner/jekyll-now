Islais Creek sits at the mouth of the [Bernal Heights watershed in San Francisco, California](http://explore.museumca.org/creeks/1630-RescIslais.html#). The 3rd St. bridge closes off the creek from the channel at the east end, while the tall, meandering lanes of the 280 and all of its speeding cars create an ominous, impenetrable barrier at the west end.

> Islais Creek was fed, in part, by a stream that flowed down from the hills by way of what is today Alemany Boulevard. It was in this creek that we boys would catch pollywogs and bring them home, much to the consternation of our mothers. Mothers failed to find the creatures to be an adornment to their households. Today that stream is a busy highway carrying a heavy stream of automotive traffic.
>> Excerpt from Frank R. Quinn's 1984 memoir, *Growing Up in the Mission*

The landscape surrounding the creek is a somber mix of over-grown weeds, litter, and industrial stuctures, including concrete blocks, rusted steel beams, and wooden posts protruding from the water. Just beyond the raised banks on the northern end of the creek, rows of empty cars, vans, and tour buses stand at attention, waiting patiently until called upon by the myriad of auto and tourist companies that help keep San Francisco's commuters in constant movement. The southern end of the creek is similarly serene with its collection of low-profile, garage-front and warehouse businesses, a scene altogether quite different from the hustle and bustle of the waterfront and Mission areas mere blocks away.

To most of the residents of San Francisco, Islais Creek is largely unknown. Its location, reputation for attracting skaters and homeless individuals, and industrial surroundings make it a less-than-popular destination spot. The natural and physical form of the creek, just like its history, meanders in and out of visibility, largely due to the whim of city planners who have made decisions with people and profit first, nature second. Most of Islais Creek remains hidden underground, built over by years of urban development.


## The water (and the history) underneath

Looking at the creek today, it is difficult to imagine that it was once the primary source of the city's water. In the early development of San Francisco, [85% of all drinking water came from Islais Creek](http://art-ecology.com/?page_id=881). The creek used to be about four miles in length, stretching from the Bay all the way to the Pacific Ocean. But the creek underwent dramatic changes during the 20th century as San Francisco transformed into an urban mecca. From 1870 to the early 1990s, the area around Islais Creek was flanked by slaughterhouses and dubbed ["Butchertown."](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/us/28bcintel.html) Though increasing health hazards spurred regulation and the construction of modern meat-packing factories forced most of the slaughterhouses to shut down, Islais Creek remained an open sewage. During this time, Islais Creek earned the moniker ["Shit Creek"](https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/islais-creek)." The size of Islais Creek was reduced by [80% to what it is today](http://art-ecology.com/?page_id=881) after the devastating 1906 earthquake, when city officials decided to clear the city of debris by dumping it into the creek.

We often take for granted how precious water is. 

But recently, the attitude towards the creek is changing. Over the past few years, there have been several efforts by different groups to "daylight" Islais Creek. The process of [daylighting](http://americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AmericanRivers_daylighting-streams-report.pdf), according to [AmericanRivers.org](https://www.americanrivers.org/conservation-resource/daylighting-streams-breathing-life-urban-streams-communities/), "involves uncovering some or all of the previously covered river, stream, or stormwater drainage. Although most stream daylighting involves restoring a stream to a more natural state, other forms include architectural and cultural restoration."

Ironically, more of the "uncovering" of Islais Creek is happening through these latter forms of restoration. [Julia Viera](http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Copra_Crane_in_Islais_Creek) gathered her neighbors and formed "Friends of Islais Creek" in the 1980's and convinced the Port of San Francisco to put off destorying the infamous Copra Crane until a park could be built along the creek. A statue and marquee commemorating Islais were erected when the [3rd St. bridge was put in place](https://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/islais-creek-par.html). Another [sculpture](https://hoodline.com/2018/05/sf-port-arts-commission-unveils-islais-creek-sculpture) by artist Cliff Garten was erected earlier this year. A group hoping to save the Copra Crane danced upon it in 1999, but the crane was ultimately dismantled and removed in subsequent years.

My intent with these blog posts goes beyond trying to push to "daylight" Islais Creek into some semblance of its natural form. I also hope to use these posts as an opportunity to reconnect the people of San Francisco to its aquatic infrastructures, its history, and the complex urban-aquatic nexus that forces us to challenge our role in the ongoing problems of climate change. In this series of blog posts, I introduce the history of Islais Creek, community and business efforts to revive the creek in various ways, all the while integrating the impact that climate change has had on all of these endeavours.










The movement to daylight Islais Creek echoes broader efforts worldwide to better address the urban resilience, the intersection of human development.

Talk about water… Talk about aquatic/urban nexus…

Removing housing and reintroducing open water into an urban community would require
community outreach and education to help people appreciate the stream and visualize the potential
for neighborhood improvement.
Daylighting Islais Creek for stormwater conveyance would reduce combined sewer
overflows into San Francisco Bay and the city streets, reduce the threat of flooding, reduce the 
21
inflow to wastewater treatment plants, create aquatic habitat, create public recreational space, and
advance understanding of urban water management.

## Climate change/Frankenstein

Some have called climate change one of society's modern-day "Frankenstein's" (Joshua Rothman, *The New Yorker*). Like Frankenstein, climate change was made by and is continually scorned by its creator: the human race. Climate change is easy to ignore... when everything is going fine. But increasing severe weather patterns, expose the incredible, destructive power humans have had on this planet.

Humans, in their widespread geographic locales, collectively contribute to this global problem (though some more than others.) Ironically, there is one element that humans cannot repair nor replace, and this is water. 




## So, what happens next?

I found Islais Creek back in college when I was obsessed with paddling. At the time, I had my own canoe but wanted to train sprints somewhere where the water was flat. The problem with my relationship with the creek was that like most of the city of San Francisco, I had no idea about the history of the creek and was merely using it for my own selfish purposes. That’s when I became more involved with the volunteer organizations that help keep the creek clean.

Why was there so much interest in preserving this tiny creek? This tiny creek had a massive role in the urban development of San Francisco.

While some political leaders are dragging their feet on climate change policy, some citizens have had enough. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.
