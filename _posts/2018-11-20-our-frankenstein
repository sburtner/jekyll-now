In college I was obsessed with paddling. I would often ditch class if the weather was good to take an outrigger canoe out into the Bay, launching from a boat dock in Alameda. The view of San Francisco is stunning from the water. The city seems to exist as one massive entity, not a collection of a billion moving parts. The infrastructure of the city is mostly invisible from the water, as buildings and houses are all one can really see just a mile or two offshore.



Of course, the water in the Bay can be tumultuous. A single mariner in a non-motorized boat has to be careful of the undulating waves, large cargo ships, and the occasional curious seal hoping for a rest on a smooth hull. During my college years, I was hoping to find a stretch of water to train on nearby that was flat, smooth, and protected. I pulled up Google Maps one day and didn't find much in the East Bay that I didn't already know about (aka had gotten bored by.) But upon looking onto the earstern shores of San Francisco, I came across a little channel named "Islais Creek." A few days later I drove my car out there and met with someone from the local paddling group, Kayaks Unlimited. From then on the creek would become an important part of my training, my community outreach, and my closeness to San Francisco. Little did I know that each time I paddled at Islais Creek, I was launching a canoe from diminishing shores, paddling on polluted and unsanitary water, and merely skimming the surface of problems surrounding urban development amd climate change.

## Urban-water nexus and urban resilience

What does it mean for a city to be "resilient"? According to the UN 2017 report, [*Trends in Urban Resilience*](https://unhabitat.org/books/trends-in-urban-resilience-2017/), "the resilience of a city is directly dependent on 'the capability of all the physical components of the system, including buildings and transportation infrastructures, to absorb the damages due to an external shock and to quickly restore their state before the shock.'" Resilience can be viewed from engineering, ecological, and socio-ecological perspectives, but across these frames, is still "viewed as a process, a state and a quality."

Why does resilience matter? Humans seem to be evolving just fine, adapting to

The movement to daylight Islais Creek echoes broader efforts within the Bay and worldwide to better address urban resilience.

> "Removing housing and reintroducing open water into an urban community would require community outreach and education to help people appreciate the stream and visualize the potential for neighborhood improvement. Daylighting Islais Creek for stormwater conveyance would reduce combined sewer overflows into San Francisco Bay and the city streets, reduce the threat of flooding, reduce the 21 inflow to wastewater treatment plants, create aquatic habitat, create public recreational space, and advance understanding of urban water management.

While some political leaders are dragging their feet on climate change policy, some citizens have had enough. The recent [bridge protests in London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion) highlight the pressing demands of concerned citizens.
