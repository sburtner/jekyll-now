# Daylighting Islais Creek
## *A Mapstory*

## Description

A map is a resprentation of the real physical world, and it communicates a story through a conscious management of shapes, colors, textures, and layers. My work is a geographic information science approach to **critical infrastructure**, and tries to separate out the "infrastructure" of a city at the **urban-water nexus**. As someone who loves water and the Bay Area, I feature **Islais Creek** in San Francisco, California, as my study area. I choose to layer those traditional infrastructural elements of an urban area such as highways, roads, bridges and buildings with aquatic features such as shoreline, marshes, and rivers. Each map layer "**daylights**" some aspect of urban and aquatic infrastructure, and culminates in a series of maps that I call **NEXUS**. In NEXUS, one can see all of the urban structures of a city, but where this is water, I leave the historical map of Islais Creek, so that the map reader can be reminded of the centrality of water to urban life.
