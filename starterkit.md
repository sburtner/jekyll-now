# Daylighting Islais Creek through Maps

## Description

A map is a resprentation of the physical world, and it communicates a story through a careful management of shapes, colors, textures, and layers. My work is a **geographic information science** (a mapping) approach to **critical infrastructure**, and tries to separate out the infrastructural components of a city at the **urban-water nexus**. The urban-water nexus describes the geographic areas at which humans and water interact. Central to this approach is the consideration of **climate change**, and how its increasing variability and unpredictability will affect human life.

One attempt to address the challenges of climate change at the urban-water nexus is to revitalize more sustainable practices in water management. "**Daylighting**" creeks, rivers, and streams so that they follow more of their natural flow and are less prone to flooding is increasing in popularity (daylighting can involve cultural restoration too, see [this blog post](https://sburtner.github.io/shit-creek/).) As someone who loves water and the Bay Area, I feature **Islais Creek** in San Francisco, California, as my area of interest to daylight. I choose to layer those traditional infrastructural elements of an urban environment such as highways, roads, bridges and buildings with aquatic features such as shoreline, marshes, and rivers. Each map layer "**daylights**" some aspect of urban and aquatic infrastructure across time and space, and culminates in a series of maps that I call **NEXUS**. In NEXUS, one can see all of the urban structures of a city, but where there is water, I leave the historical map of Islais Creek, so that the map reader can be reminded of the centrality of water to urban life.
